## üîß Setup & Requirements

### üìã Necessary Specifications

#### To run this project locally you will need:

- **ASP .NET Core :** You can check if you have .NET Core by running `dotnet --version` in the command line. If you do not have .NET Core please find more information and download [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core)
- **MySQL :**  You can download MySQL [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484914) and MySQL Workbench [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484391)
- **Prefered Code Editor**


### ‚öôÔ∏è Clone or Download

#### To Download:

Go to my GitHub repository here, [https://guthub.com/kaila.spraguemcrae/Travel.Solution](https://guthub.com/kaila.spraguemcrae/Travel.Solution), and click on the green 'Code' button to clone the repository, Open with GitHub Desktop OR Download the ZIP file

#### To clone (my prefered method):

1. Push the green 'Clone' button and copy the URL.
2. Open Terminal or GitBash and input the command: `git clone https://github.com/kaila-spraguemcrae/Travel.Solution`
3. To view the code, open the copied directory with Visual Studio Code or your preferred text editor by inputing the command `code .` in your terminal.

### üß∞ Database Setup Options

#### AppSettings:

- After you have the project on your computer you will need to create a file in the root directory of the project called "appsettings.json". 
- Add the following snippet of code to the appsettings.json file:

```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=kaila_spraguemcrae_french_bakery;uid=root;pwd=YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE;"
    }
}
```
*Please note you will need to replace `YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE` with the password you created for your MySQL server.
*You may also need to update `uid`, `port`, or `database` name depending on your configurations.

#### Import Database using Entity Framework Core:

 - In the command line run ` cd Desktop/Travel.Solution/Travel` to navigate to the "FrechBakery" folder. 
 - Next, run `dotnet ef database update` to generate the database. You can confirm the database was created by checking MySQL workbench.

*to make changed to the database you can run `dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName>`

#### Running/viewing application:

1. Once you have opened the code in your preferred text editor you will need to navigate to the 'Travel.Solution/Travel' folder (`cd Travel`) in the command line and run `dotnet run` or `dotnet watch run`.
2. At this point you should be able to click on the link to the local server's url path to view the compiled project.

# üõ∏ API Documentation
In order to explore the endpoints of this API, we suggest that you use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). Postman will allow you to make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests with the TravelrApi.

## JWT Web Token Authorization

- Travelr API uses JWT Web Tokens to authorize users based on their user roles. "User" users are able to make GET requests only, whereas "Admin" users are able to make POST, PUT, and DELETE in addition to GET requests.
- To receive an authorization token, you will first need to authenticate a user in either an "Admin" or "User" role. For the purposes of this API demo, user paramaters have been generated for both roles. Please refer to the below authentication instructions based on the user role you'd like to create.

### "Admin" User Creation

- Create a POST request to http://localhost:5004/api/users/authenticate
- Navigate to the "Body" tab of your request and select "Raw Data" from the offered options followed by "JSON" in the dropdown to the right of your selection. Enter the following code snippet into the body field
```
{
    "Username": "admin",
    "Password": "admin"
}
```
The response will generate a bearer token. Copy this token for use when you create a new request (GET, POST, DELETE, PUT). When creating a new request, navigate to the "Authorizations" tab. Select "Bearer Token" as the authorization type, and paste your copied token into the "Token" field. This token will authorize your requests. 

### "User" User Creation


- Create a POST request to http://localhost:5004/api/users/authenticate
- Navigate to the "Body" tab of your request and select "Raw Data" from the offered options followed by "JSON" in the dropdown to the right of your selection. Enter the following code snippet into the body field
```
{
    "Username": "user",
    "Password": "user"
}
```
The response will generate a bearer token. Copy this token for use when you create a new GET request. When creating a new request, navigate to the "Authorizations" tab. Select "Bearer Token" as the authorization type, and paste your copied token into the "Token" field. This token will authorize your GET requests only. 


## Endpoints

Base URL : `http://localhost:5004`

### HTTP Request Structure

```

POST /api/destination
GET /api/destination{id}
PUT /api/destination{id}
DELETE /api/destination{id}
```
### Path Paramaters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |:------------- |
| cityname | string | none | false | Return matches by city name |
| country | string | none | false | Return matches by country name |
| rating | int | none | false | Return matches by rating number between 0-5 |

### Example Query

`http://localhost:5004/api/destination/?country=japan&rating=5`
