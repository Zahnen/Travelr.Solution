## üîß Setup & Requirements

### üìã Necessary Specifications

#### To run this project locally you will need:

- **ASP .NET Core :** You can check if you have .NET Core by running `dotnet --version` in the command line. If you do not have .NET Core please find more information and download [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core)
- **MySQL :**  You can download MySQL [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484914) and MySQL Workbench [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484391)
- **Prefered Code Editor**


### ‚öôÔ∏è Clone or Download

#### To Download:

Go to my GitHub repository here, [https://guthub.com/kaila.spraguemcrae/Travel.Solution](https://guthub.com/kaila.spraguemcrae/Travel.Solution), and click on the green 'Code' button to clone the repository, Open with GitHub Desktop OR Download the ZIP file

#### To clone (my prefered method):

1. Push the green 'Clone' button and copy the URL.
2. Open Terminal or GitBash and input the command: `git clone https://github.com/kaila-spraguemcrae/Travel.Solution`
3. To view the code, open the copied directory with Visual Studio Code or your preferred text editor by inputing the command `code .` in your terminal.

### üß∞ Database Setup Options

#### AppSettings:

- After you have the project on your computer you will need to create a file in the root directory of the project called "appsettings.json". 
- Add the following snippet of code to the appsettings.json file:

```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=kaila_spraguemcrae_french_bakery;uid=root;pwd=YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE;"
    }
}
```
*Please note you will need to replace `YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE` with the password you created for your MySQL server.
*You may also need to update `uid`, `port`, or `database` name depending on your configurations.

#### Import Database using Entity Framework Core:

 - In the command line run ` cd Desktop/Travel.Solution/Travel` to navigate to the "FrechBakery" folder. 
 - Next, run `dotnet ef database update` to generate the database. You can confirm the database was created by checking MySQL workbench.

*to make changed to the database you can run `dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName>`

#### Running/viewing application:

1. Once you have opened the code in your preferred text editor you will need to navigate to the 'Travel.Solution/Travel' folder (`cd Travel`) in the command line and run `dotnet run` or `dotnet watch run`.
2. At this point you should be able to click on the link to the local server's url path to view the compiled project.
